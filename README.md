HuddleHive's WIT Hackathon #3

Aim: Discover the spaces between places.

In every city, there are corners of community waiting to be found—spaces that aren't home, aren't work, but feel like both. Hidden Spaces is a platform built to uncover and activate these "third spaces"—quiet courtyards, creative hubs, backroom bookshops, and neighborhood nooks—where people can gather, connect, and belong.

Whether you're looking for somewhere to host a workshop, start a book club, or just vibe with your people, Hidden Spaces makes it easy to:

🔍 Find nearby third spaces that match your vibe and needs
🗺️ Add new spots you stumble across, turning the city into a living map
🤝 Connect with space owners and other community-minded folks
🔁 Manage recurring events or pop-ups in cool, unexpected places

We're here to bridge the gap between people searching for connection and the underused spaces that can host it. This is more than just an app—it's a movement to reclaim and reimagine our cities.
